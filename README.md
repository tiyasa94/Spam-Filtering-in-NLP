### Overview
This is a simple spam classifier example based on Natural Language Processing in Python.
### Motivation
In present day of modern technology, the ratio of spam reports is increasig day by day. That's why I thought it can be a good start to get my hands dirty on this problem using ML and DL techniques.  
### Technical Aspect
This project is divided into three parts:
1. Cleaning and preprocessing of collected data.
2. Training various machine learning and deep learning models.
3. Comparing the accuracy of different models on the test data.
### Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.9. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:
[pip install -r requirements.txt](pip install -r requirements.txt)
